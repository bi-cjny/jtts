##What it is

Julie Through The System is a curriculum developed at the Burns Institute
designed to educate kids about the juvenile justice system. Originally a
choose-your-own-adventure style card game, the player moves from scene to 
scene presented with courses of action based on their previous choices.
The player traverses the myriad paths through the juvenile justice system,
learning legal vocab as they go.

##Where it's going

A simple story-telling system at the moment, we hope to add the following
features:
- Hand-drawn illustrations and animated scenes
- A modern UI focusing on user experience
- Educational aides such as tool tips and vocab quizzes
- Social media integration
